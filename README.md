This is the front-end of Garage Log, a project which is made for logging maintenance which has been done on vehciles.
The project uses the .Net framework for the server side/back-end and ReactJS for the client side/front-end.

The main purpose of this project is to show the use of a .Net Api used with ReactJS front end.

Server-Side Repository: https://github.com/goodjonte/GarageLogApi

## Projects Features

.Net Backend Web API
Making Api request to the server from ReactJS front end
User Login
Use of JWT tokens for authentication
React-Router-Dom package for routing
Use of React Hooks
Use of custom React Components

## Notes:

Security is not prioriteized in this project for purposes of testing and developing, so the use of JWT tokens isnt the best (for example expiration of the tokens is not set up).
Also to register a user u just eneter a username and password, in a real world application you would also have a email field and get users to verify their email address.
